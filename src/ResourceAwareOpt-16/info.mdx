# Resource Aware Optimization
Resource-Aware Optimization is the "Traffic Cop" or "Gatekeeper" pattern. Instead of sending every request to a massive, high-latency model (like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet), the system uses a smaller, faster "judge" model or a set of rules to decide the most efficient execution path.

# Main Constraints 
1. Cost
2. Latency
3. Accuracy

# How to use
1. Model Cascading
2. Dynamic Token Management
3. Tiered Routing
