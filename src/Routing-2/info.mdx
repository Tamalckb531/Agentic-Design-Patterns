# Routing

An agent can't have only one workflow cause user can ask for many things. So we can create routes to redirect the workflow in different sub-agents or functions according to user's query. 

### Here are some kind of routing process :

- LLM Based -> we can ask llm to categorize the query first and then select workflow for the query
- Embedding based -> Basically used in RAG where query is matched with closest meaning vector embeddings and the redirect to different workflows
- Rule based -> We set some predefined rule here and then write conditional logic to select the optimum workflow
- ML model based -> Use a fine tuned discriminative model like classifier to select the workflow path

** we use Langgraph mostly for routing pattern

### Code understanding
We invoke agent with a request -> Call a sequence of routing steps with RunnableSequence.from() -> It first call the llm with request to get the classification and pass the input in pipeline as well-> Than call delegationBranch which conditionally identify route with RunnableBranch.from() then run sub-agents according to the route with RunnablePassthrough.assign and store the output -> it returns the output
