# Routing

An agent can't have only one workflow cause user can ask for many things. So we can create routes to redirect the workflow in different sub-agents or functions according to user's query. 

### Here are some kind of routing process :

- LLM Based -> we can ask llm to categorize the query first and then select workflow for the query
- Embedding based -> Basically used in RAG where query is matched with closest meaning vector embeddings and the redirect to different workflows
- Rule based -> We set some predefined rule here and then write conditional logic to select the optimum workflow
- ML model based -> Use a fine tuned discriminative model like classifier to select the workflow path

** we use Langgraph mostly for routing pattern
