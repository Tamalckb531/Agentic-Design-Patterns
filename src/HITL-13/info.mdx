# Human in the Loop:
Like cursor where Human are involved marking if the code should be applied or not. Here Human make sure AI agent's response will not do any harm and approve them to process further.

# Cons :
It doesn't scale up as stuff can't be automated when it needs to be. But works fine where AI interact with clients as the Human in the loop as we see in cursor.

## Use Cases :

- Content Moderation
- Autonomous Driving
