# Model Context Protocol(MCP):
MCP provides a standardized interface for llm to interact with external resources. It follows a client server model. Where server is data source (like an excel sheet or external api) and client is the data receiver (Like cursor or AI agent that I am building)

## Flows:
Discovery -> Request Formulation -> Client Communication -> Server Execution -> Response and Context Update

## Cons:
CrewAi only works for python. KaibanJs have the criteria to use openAi must also same for CrewAi-js. But I can learn how developer created CrewAi-js to implement it by myself

## Use Cases :

- Database Integration
- Generative Media Orchestration
- External API Interaction
- Reasoning-Based Information Extraction
- Custom Tool Development
- Standardized LLM-to-Application Communication
- Complex Workflow Orchestration
- IoT Device Control
- Financial Services Automation
