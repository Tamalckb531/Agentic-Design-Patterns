# Planning:
When the "how" of a query given to agent is not defined, then agent needs to plan out all uncertainty of approaches it will take so that, if one approach fail, it won't just fail but explore other approaches dynamically. This is called Planning design pattern. 

## Important Notation:
These are kind of stuff that I will not use in maximum time while building agents. I will look it up when I gonna feel like every single query asked to agent will be so complex that result must get impure. So this Planning will break down queries and done the process of finding result in step by step way also considering the uncertainties.
