# Reasoning Techniques
Evaluation and Monitoring provide the "Operational Feedback Loop" for an agent. Instead of assuming the agent is performing well based on a few successful runs, this pattern implements systematic, continuous measurement of performance, cost, and reliability.

# Main Constraints 
1. LLM as a judge 
2. Telemetry & Tracing
3. Resource Tracking

# How to use
1. Build a "Golder Dataset"
2. Implement "Drift Detection"
3. Enable "Human in the Loop" Sampling.
