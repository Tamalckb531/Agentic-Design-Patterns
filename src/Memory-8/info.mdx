# Memory Management:
A system helps agents to manage memory so that it can retain information.

## Types:
1. Contextual Memory -> Basically short term memory. Hold prev chats, tool results and reflections. But get lost when a session concludes. 
1. Persistent Memory -> Basically long term memory. Agent have data's stored in database that match it's persona or workflows. Mostly we use vector database as we can do semantic search in that.  

## Use Cases :

- Chatbots and Conversational AI.
- Task Oriented Agents
- Personalized Experiences
- Learning and Improvement
- Information Retrieval (RAG)
- Autonomous Systems
